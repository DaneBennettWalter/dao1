# DAO1

## What it is

DAO1 is a set of tools that let people own things together and make decisions together — without needing lawyers, landlords, or a computer science degree to do it.

That's it. Everything else is implementation detail.

## Why it exists

Ownership is broken. Not in a dramatic, manifesto-writing way — just in a practical, everyday way:

- A group of people want to buy and manage a property together. Right now, that requires lawyers, LLCs, operating agreements, and someone everyone trusts to hold the keys. It's expensive, slow, and fragile.
- A hotel has 67 rooms and tenants who care about where they live. They have no say in how things run. The owner wants their input but has no good way to collect it.
- A 73-acre community wants residents to participate in decisions about shared gardens, livestock, events, and infrastructure. A Facebook group doesn't cut it.
- A food bank needs donations and transparency about where the money goes. Current tools make this harder than it should be.

DAO1 solves these problems with software. Not with tokens or wallets or gas fees — with simple tools that work like texting, tapping a button, or scanning a code.

## How it works (for the person using it)

**You get a link. You tap it. You're in.**

That's the experience. No app to download. No wallet to set up. No seed phrase to write down on a piece of paper and lose.

Want to vote on whether the community garden gets expanded? You get a text: "Should we expand the garden this spring? Tap YES or NO." You tap. Done. Your vote counts.

Want to see how donations to the food bank are being spent? You visit a page. It shows you. Every dollar, every transaction, updated in real time.

Want to invest in a property development? You see the deal, the numbers, the terms. You commit. Your ownership is recorded, your returns are tracked, and you can see the whole picture anytime.

The technology underneath — blockchain, smart contracts, cryptographic verification — exists to make this trustworthy. But you never have to see it or think about it. It's plumbing. You just turn on the faucet.

## What's running right now

DAO1 isn't a whitepaper. It's a set of real operations:

### Hotel Brendle — Robstown, TX
A 67-room historic hotel. The birthplace of Texas Hold'em. Currently housing 27 tenants at $600-700/month, with a renovation plan that takes it to full capacity at $750/month across all units. Projected value after renovation: $6.2 million.

But it's more than a hotel. The Brendle is a place where people who were on the streets can find a room, get stable, and start rebuilding. It makes money *and* does good. That's not an accident — that's the model.

### Homestead San Marcos — Kingsbury, TX
73 acres of open Texas prairie being developed into a sustainable community. 29 one-acre home tracts. 110 RV sites. Community gardens, livestock, shared agricultural spaces. Affordable living that doesn't look or feel like "affordable living."

This is what it looks like when you build housing that respects the land and the people living on it.

### Robstown House of Prayer
A historic church being restored as a food bank, worship center, and community anchor. $120,000 renovation funded by the community, for the community.

### CBBTX — Coastal Bend Builders
A construction company that does real work: demolition, renovation, building. The labor engine behind the properties. The construction funnels (wedemoit.com and others) capture leads and distribute work to the people who do it.

### SpaceCamp TX
Education, enthusiasm, speakers, and recruiting — all in one event, for all ages. Building community around space and the people working to get us there.

### Deep Tech Stir Fry
A roving event series for the brightest minds in any room. City to city. High-brow conversation. Low-ego energy. Building culture one dinner party at a time.

## The flywheel

Here's how it all connects:

1. **Construction funnels** capture demand (people need things built or torn down)
2. **AI-powered bid automation** processes requests and generates estimates
3. **Labor distribution** routes work to the right people
4. **Revenue** from construction funds the real estate development
5. **Properties** (Brendle, Homestead) create communities
6. **Communities** generate culture (events, food banks, gardens)
7. **Culture** attracts people who want to participate
8. **Participation** is managed through DAO1 governance
9. **Governance** makes everything transparent and accountable
10. **Trust** makes the whole thing grow

Each piece feeds the next. Nothing exists in isolation.

## The technology (for people who care about this part)

DAO1 uses blockchain where it actually matters and stays out of the way where it doesn't.

**Where blockchain matters:**
- Recording ownership that can't be disputed or altered
- Distributing revenue automatically to the right people
- Making governance votes tamper-proof
- Creating transparency that doesn't depend on trusting one person

**Where it doesn't:**
- User interfaces (these are just web pages and text messages)
- Day-to-day operations (the hotel still runs like a hotel)
- Communication (Nostr for decentralized messaging, plain SMS for voting)

**Stack:**
- Bitcoin-anchored state records for ownership and governance events
- Nostr for decentralized identity and communication
- NEAR protocol for programmable contracts where needed
- Simple web interfaces for everything user-facing
- SMS/text for voting and notifications

## What "ownership" means here

When we say you can "own" part of a property through DAO1, we mean:

- Your ownership is recorded on a public ledger that nobody controls
- You receive your share of revenue automatically
- You can vote on decisions proportional to your stake
- You can transfer your ownership to someone else
- You can verify all of this yourself, anytime

This isn't a stock certificate in a filing cabinet. It's a living record that works for you.

## What's next

**Now:** Getting the existing operations running smoothly. Hotel Brendle generating revenue. Homestead San Marcos attracting investors and residents. Construction funnels capturing leads. Events building community.

**Soon:** DAO1 governance tools deployed at Brendle as a pilot. Residents voting on property decisions. Investors tracking returns in real time. Donations to the House of Prayer fully transparent.

**Later:** The model scales. More properties. More communities. More cities. The same tools that manage 67 hotel rooms can manage a neighborhood, a town, a sustainable city built from scratch.

**Eventually:** If you can coordinate people to build communities on Earth, you can coordinate them to build habitats in space. That's not a metaphor. That's the long game.

## Who's building this

A guy in Texas who's tried about 40 ideas and failed at most of them. Who runs a construction company, manages a hotel, feeds people at a food bank, and writes code at night. Who believes you can make money and do good at the same time — not as a slogan, but as an operating principle.

Flawed like everyone. Doing his best like everyone. Building something worth building.
